# Instapaper2Pocket
Handy script to migrate your Instapaper account to Pocket.

Unfortunately [Pocket's import from Instapaper](https://getpocket.com/import/instapaper/) is flawed in many ways. This script does proper job:
 - Instapaper's all starred articles are added as favorites and archived in Pocket.
 - All unread articles are added as unread in Pocket.
 - All archived articles are added as archived in Pocket obviously.
 - Order of articles in Pocket will be the same as in Instapaper.
